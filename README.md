[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

Current website URL: https://new-website-phi-liart.vercel.app/ 
(will probably shell out a few dollars for a better domain, that or figure out how to host this with github pages instead of Vercel)

ToDo:

- Add photos

- Add "About Me" section

- Clean up the main page (random components)

- Swap out the default favicon for homepage

- Add a github actions pipeline
